(* Problem: You are given n binary values x0, x1, . . . , xnâˆ’1, such that xi in {0, 1}.
 * This array represents holes in a roof (1 is a hole). You are also given k boards
 * of the same size.
 * The goalis to choose the optimal (minimal) size of the boards that allows
 * all the holes to be coveredby boards.

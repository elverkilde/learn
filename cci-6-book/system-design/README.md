# How would you design...

The idea with this series of blog posts is to explore how one would go about designing
large scale systems.

Each blog post will present an evolution of a design using 3 steps:
- a initial simple system to get started
- a second more advanced system with a larger set of features
- and finally an analysis of what we know the professionals are doing!

For each stage, we will list the pros and cons and also potential alternatives.
We will supply diagrams to help understand the flows and walk through relevant use cases.

Finally, each design exercise is a live document, it's meant to be continuously
expanded and improved. Please open up a PR at this link to add your improvements.

# Hello World

This is my first attempt at building a lambda-backed serverless service.

The endpoint is available at: `https://hoa58j9rm3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello-world`

The definition of the function is at: `https://platform.serverless.com/services/topliceanu/serverless-hello-world`

### Next:
- [] build a simple, in-memory, todo list to example the SAM.
- [] attach a storage layer, SimpleDB maybe?

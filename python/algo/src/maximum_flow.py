def ford_fulkerson_maximum_flow(g, s, t):
    """ Solves the maximum flow problem using the ford-fulkerson algorithm.

    Given a directed weighted graph g, a source vertex s and a sink vertex t,
    send as much flow as possible from s to t, knowing that each edge has a
    capacity value which is the maximum ammount of flow that the edge can
    accomodate.

    Discovered by Lester Ford and Delbert Fulkerson in 1956.

    Running time: O(m*f) where m - number of edges, f - value of max flow
                (Note! we assume edge capacities are integers)

    See: minimum cut problem (maximum flow reduces to minimum cut)
    See: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/08-network-flow-problems.pdf for reference implementation.
    See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm

    TODO fix the case when there are pairs of nodes which have edges in both directions.

    Params:
        g: object, instance of src.graph.Graph
        s: str, name of the source vertex
        t: str, name of the sink vertex

    Returns:
        max_flow: int, the maximum ammount of flow you can send from s to t
        flow: object, instance of src.graph.Graph, each edge corresponds to the
            maximum flow passing through that edge.

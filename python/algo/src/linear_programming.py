def simplex(A, b, c):
    """ Soves the set of linear inequalities specified by A b and c vectors of
    coefficients, using the simplex method.

    Developed by George Dantzig in 1947

    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm

    Args:
        A: bidimensional array of coeficients
        b: vector of coefficients
        c: vector of coefficients

    Returns:
        a vector of values for the requested variables.

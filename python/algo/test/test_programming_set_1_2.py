Download the text file here. [./QuickSort.txt]

The file contains all of the integers between 1 and 10,000
(inclusive, with no repeats) in unsorted order.
The integer in the ith row of the file gives you
the ith entry of an input array.

Your task is to compute the total number of comparisons used
to sort the given input file by QuickSort. As you know, the number
of comparisons depends on which elements are chosen as pivots,
so we'll ask you to explore three different pivoting rules.
You should not count comparisons one-by-one. Rather, when there
is a recursive call on a subarray of length m, you should simply
add m−1 to your running total of comparisons. (This is because
the pivot element is compared to each of the other m−1 elements
in the subarray in this recursive call.)

WARNING: The Partition subroutine can be implemented in several
different ways, and different implementations can give you
differing numbers of comparisons. For this problem, you should
implement the Partition subroutine exactly as it is described in
the video lectures (otherwise you might get the wrong answer).

DIRECTIONS FOR THIS PROBLEM:

For the first part of the programming assignment, you should always
use the first element of the array as the pivot element.

HOW TO GIVE US YOUR ANSWER:

Type the numeric answer in the space provided.
So if your answer is 1198233847, then just type 1198233847 in the
space provided without any space / commas / other punctuation marks.
You have 5 attempts to get the correct answer.
(We do not require you to submit your code, so feel free to use
the programming language of your choice, just type the numeric
answer in the following space.)
